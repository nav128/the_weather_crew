# Project notes

Context comment:
- Use this file to capture setup notes, local development instructions, and decisions.
- Keep it human readable; avoid secrets. Use `README.md` for end-user documentation and this file for developer notes.

Example entries to add later:
- Local env variables to set
- Known limitations and TODOs
- Links to design docs or external APIs used
