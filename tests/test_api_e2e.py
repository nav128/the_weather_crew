"""
End-to-end tests for the API.

Context comment:
- These tests should spin up the FastAPI test client and exercise critical endpoints (happy path + auth failures).
- Keep E2E tests isolated and fast; prefer using test doubles for external services.

Placeholder file: implement real e2e tests using `starlette.testclient` / `httpx`.
