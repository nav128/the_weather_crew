API logging configuration

Context comment:
- Centralize API logging configuration here (formatters, handlers, request logging).
- Integrate structured logging and correlation IDs for request tracing.

Placeholder only: actual logging setup (dictConfig/structlog/etc.) should be implemented when needed.

# Note: Keep logging configuration import-safe and idempotent.
