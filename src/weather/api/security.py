"""
API security utilities

Context comment:
- This module should contain API key checks, auth dependencies, and security helpers used by the API.
- Example responsibilities: APIKeyHeader dependency, request validation, and raising proper HTTP errors.

Placeholder only: add real checks and secret handling in a secure manner when implementing.

# Note: Keep security logic unit-testable and side-effect free where possible.
