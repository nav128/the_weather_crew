# Dockerfile placeholder
# should start from `Ubuntu 24.04 LTS` or `python:3.12-slim` image, 
# `pip install crewai[tools] pytest`
# Context comment:
# - Containerize the application here. Keep images minimal and pin base images.
# - Example responsibilities: install runtime, copy source, set workdir, expose ports, declare entrypoint.
#
# Replace with a concrete multi-stage Dockerfile tailored to the project's runtime (uv/crew runtime) when implementing.
